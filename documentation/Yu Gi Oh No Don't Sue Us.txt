			VISION STATEMENT
Yu Gi Oh No Don't Sue Us is a web application that maintains a database of the 
cards in the Yu Go Oh™ trading card game. User can sign up to be database 
curators, at which point they can add cards that are not already in the 
database. 

			SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
In order to run the application, the following software is needed:
	#JDK
	#mySQL
	#playframework
	#scala 
	
				STATUS REPORT
Currently, the application has working business logic. Users are able to sign 
up, log in, and submit cards to the database. All this information persists, but 
the application as a whole could be improved visiually, and funtioanlly.  

				ITERATION PLAN
If work continues on this project, we would focus on three main improvements. 
Firstly, the main page does display the cards in the database, but not
correctly. Secondly, we would like to implement more robust data validation 
when users enter card data. Third, we would like to implement a means of editing 
or deleting the cards already present.

				ISSUE LOG
To this point, there have been three big issues. Figuring out the structure
of the application (playframework routes and views) was the first big issue we 
faced. Next, we had to figure out how to create a form for users to enter card 
data. The last big issue we faced was creating the business logic of the 
application - storing the user entered data and displaying the data on the main
page.
